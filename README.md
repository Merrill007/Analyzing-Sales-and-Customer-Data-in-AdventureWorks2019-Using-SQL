The analysis was carried out by running SQL queries on the AdventureWorks2019 database. The following are the key insights from the analysis:

1. The best selling products in each category were identified
2. The sales trend over the years was visualized using line charts
3. The demographic information of the customers was analyzed, including age and gender distribution
4. The purchasing behavior of the customers was analyzed by looking at the frequency and amount of purchases

## Conclusion

The analysis can be used by the company to improve their sales strategy and customer experience.
